Facts we confirmed

Warband’s master list endpoint https://warbandmain.taleworlds.com/handlerservers.ashx?type=list returns only endpoints in the form IP:PORT|IP:PORT|... — no server names like NI_EU_*.

The in-game browser then sends a small UDP query to each endpoint to retrieve server info (name/module/map/players).

When joining a server, Warband sends type=chkserial including ip=IP:PORT (and your serial). That proves the game is using those endpoints.

M&B Central (mnbcentral) implements the same approach: pull TW master list, then query servers to build a web list; it also provides a scrape-friendly .../min format, but it may be incomplete.

Why your PowerShell “HTTP XML” probe misses EU servers

Your script does Invoke-WebRequest http://IP:PORT/ and parses XML tags like <Name>.

That HTTP/XML status page is not the canonical Warband query; many servers don’t expose it (or block it), so you’ll miss servers even if they’re real + joinable in-game.

Warband’s real discovery uses UDP, so your PowerShell must use UDP if you want parity with the game.

Browser/Tampermonkey feasibility (key constraint)

A userscript running in a browser cannot send arbitrary UDP packets, so it cannot directly query Warband servers to get names/maps/players (the same way the game does).

Therefore, to show a complete/accurate server list (including NI_EU), the userscript needs an HTTP source that already performed the UDP querying.

Viable implementation options for the Tampermonkey script
Option A (recommended): Your own “UDP → JSON” proxy service

Backend service (Node/Python/etc.) does:

GET TW master list type=list → parse endpoints.

UDP query each endpoint (parallel, timeouts) to get server info.

(Known from analysis: Warband client sends a small fixed UDP payload to query server info; details in community analysis.)

Filter servers where Name starts with NI_.

Serve cached JSON: /ni.json (refresh every 10–30s).

Tampermonkey does:

fetch("https://your-host/ni.json") or GM_xmlhttpRequest

Render into your existing categories based on server name (Normal/Hard/Ragnarok/Cavalry/Beginner/Other).

Pros: complete + fast + matches in-game.
Cons: requires hosting/running a small service (can be local localhost too).

Option B: Use a third-party HTTP list (fallback)

Scrape https://www.mnbcentral.net/min or similar and filter NI_.

Use GM_xmlhttpRequest to avoid CORS issues.
Pros: no backend.
Cons: may miss servers / availability issues (as you saw).

Extra debugging tip we used

You can identify which IP:PORT a server uses by sniffing the chkserial request in Wireshark (handlerservers.ashx?type=chkserial...&ip=...). Don’t log/paste your serial.
